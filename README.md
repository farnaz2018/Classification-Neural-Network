# Classification-Neural-Network
This repository contains an example of a MLP Neural Network written using Tensorflow contained in the ClassificationNN.py file. ClassificationNN is configured to perform classification on the 5 datasets datasets below:

1. MNIST (Obviously)
2. Pokerhand - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand
3. Bank - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
4. Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (HAR) - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
5. Wine = https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality  (Only 50% with this one!)
